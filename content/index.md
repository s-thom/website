I'm a random person on the internet! I've been to the [University of Waikato](https://waikato.ac.nz) to do a Bachelor's of Computing and Mathematical Sciences.

You'll find a bunch of different projects over at [GitHub](https://github.com/sthom). If you've played games with me online, you'll know there's another GitHub account I use for that with even more. 

This website is still rather quiet, and I'd like to do more with it. I'm in the process of converting/creating it, so it will get some love.
