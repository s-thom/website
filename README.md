Based on [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/), so it can generate static HTML (which gets served, meaning this site works 100% without Javascript). If you do have scripts enabled, it will then run on the browser as well, reducing the requests back to the server.

While I don't expect anyone to actually fork this repo, much less to make a PR, I've put it up on GitHub so everyone can see how I built it. Soon I might even write about it on the site (which will end up in this repo).

## Getting it running

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org).

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

Wait for it to start up, rejoice when it actually works.

To create a production build, `npm run build`.
